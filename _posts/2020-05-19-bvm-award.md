Congratulations to Leonie Henschel for the 1st place: Best Scientific Submission at the 
2020 [BVM Workshop](https://www.bvm-workshop.org/).
Our submission [Parameter Space CNN for Cortical Surface Segmentation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-29267-6_49) and
[YouTube presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KHYIrL7Lyo) has convinced the reviewers. 

In that work we investigate neural networks for spherical signals of the brain:

Spherical coordinate systems have become a standard for analyzing human cortical neuroimaging data.
Surface-based signals, such as curvature, folding patterns, functional activations, or estimates of
myelination define relevant cortical regions. Surface-based deep learning approaches, however, such
as spherical CNNs primarily focus on classification and cannot yet achieve satisfactory accuracy in
segmentation tasks. To perform surface-based segmentation of the human cortex, we introduce and
evaluate a 2D parameter space approach with view aggregation (p3CNN). We evaluate this network with
respect to accuracy and show that it outperforms the spherical CNN by a margin, increasing the
average Dice similarity score for cortical segmentation to above 0.9.
