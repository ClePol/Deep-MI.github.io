# **DeepMI FastSurfer / FreeSurfer course**

## Overview

The DeepMI lab is happy to announce a two-day, hands-on, introductory **FastSurfer/FreeSurfer course** focussing on the analysis of structural brain MRI data.

The course consists of lectures, demonstrations, and practical exercises and will cover a range of topics, such as

- Advanced deep-learning for image segmentation
- Organization, processing, and inspection (QC) of brain MRI data
- Evaluation and interpretation of results
- Generalized linear models for statistical analysis
- Future directions

The goal of the course is to equip participants with working knowledge about fundamental concepts in structural neuroimaging analysis, and enable them to conduct analyses of structural imaging data using the [FastSurfer](https://deep-mi.org/research/fastsurfer) and [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) software packages. 


## Dates 

The course will be held on **September 28 and 29** (Thursday and Friday) **between 9 am and 4:30 pm**.


## Places

The course takes place at the **German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)**, Venusberg Campus, Bonn. 

Room: **B.1.119/120**. Non-DZNE participants will be picked-up at 9 am each day at the reception in the DZNE main building.
