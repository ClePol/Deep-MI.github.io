# **DeepMI FastSurfer / FreeSurfer course**

## Overview

The Deep MI lab is happy to announce a two-day, hands-on, introductory **FreeSurfer/FastSurfer course** about the analysis of structural imaging data.

The course consists of lectures, demonstrations, and practical exercises, and will cover a range of topics, such as

- Advanced deep-learning for image segmentation
- Organization, processing, and inspection (QC) of brain MRI data
- Evaluation and interpretation of results
- Generalized linear models for statistical analysis
- Future directions

The goal of the course is to equip participants with working knowledge about fundamental concepts in structural neuroimaging analysis, and enable them to conduct analyses of structural imaging data using the [FastSurfer](https://deep-mi.org/research/fastsurfer) and [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) software packages. 


## Dates 

The course will be held on **September 28 and 29** (Thursday and Friday) **between 9 am and 4:30 pm**.


## Places

The course takes place at the **German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)** at the Venusberg Campus in Bonn. 

We will use seminar room **B.1.119/120** for the course. 

Non-DZNE participants will be picked-up at 9 am each day at the reception in the DZNE main building.

_Thursday, September 28:_

**Session 1: Introduction**

- Overview of FastSurfer and FreeSurfer (lecture)

**Session 2a: Analyzing individual cases**

- Analyzing individual cases 1: volumes (lecture)
- Introduction to Freeview (interactive)
- How to run FastSurfer (practical)

**Session 2b: Analyzing individual cases**

- Analyzing individual cases 2: surfaces (lecture)
- Exploring individual FastSurfer / FreeSurfer output (practical)
- Questions and answers (interactive)

_Friday, September 29:_

**Session 3: Group analysis**

- Group analysis (lecture)
- Group analysis (practical)

**Session 4**

- QC, troubleshooting, and manual edits (lecture)
- FreeSurfer / FastSurfer add-ons and outlook (lecture)

A detailed schedule will follow.

## Registration

The intended audience for this course is the DZNE and UKB neuroimaging community.

There is a maximum capacity of **20 participants**, which will be admitted on a first-come, first-served basis.

Please contact kersten.diers(at)dzne.de to register for the course. Registration closes once all spots are filled or latest on August 31.

There is no course fee. 


## Requirements

Participants should have initial experience in working with MRI data. 

During the course, participants will be provided with workstations, software, and materials for following the lectures and doing the practical exercises.

We cannot provide support for individual devices or datasets.
